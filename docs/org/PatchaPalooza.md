[PatchaPalooza](https://github.com/xaitax/PatchaPalooza) shows information about Windows patches from Microsoft. Due be able to control timing of updates of the latest patch information I include my own [fork](https://github.com/reuteras/PatchaPalooza).

The program must be run from the installed directory *C:\git\PatchaPalooza*. You can search for **PatchaPalooza** in the *dfirws* folder on the desktop, the resulting link will open **PowerShell** in that directory.
