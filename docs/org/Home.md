# Welcome to the dfirws wiki!

The goal for [dfirws](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws) is to have useful tools for DFIR and IR work in an easy to access way in a Windows Sandbox.

## Getting started

Start by reading [[getting started]] and continue with [[customize dfirws]]. Installation is described in the project [README.md](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/blob/main/README.md). To have a shared folder of the tools for use by a group of people look in [resources/contrib/sync](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/tree/main/resources/contrib/sync). Also look at [[changes]] to get information about updates and changes.

## Using dfirws

Look at the pages below depending on the type of file you would like to investigate. You can also look at the [[Jupyter notebooks]] that are available and that can help investigate some type of files.

- Examples using [[Didier Stevens tools]]
- [[Investigate Email]]
- [[Investigate JavaScript files]]
- [[Investigate Office files]]
- [[Investigate OneNote file]]
- [[Investigate PDF files]]
- [[Investigate PE files]]
- [[Investigate PowerShell]]
- [[Investigate ZIP files]]
- [[General tools]]

Read more about [[available tools]] here. If you miss a tool, find a problem och like to change a default configuration please submit an [issue](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/issues) on GitHub for better control and traceability.
