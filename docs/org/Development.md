## Goals

- It should be easy to use and test new tools.
- It should be easy to add new tools to the sandbox and VM.
- Tools should preferable be updated automatically. In many cases it might be better to specify specific versions that have been tested. Since I don't have the resources to test every program before updates I prefer to always update and instead fix bugs that arise. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/issues) if you find a broken tool.
- Focus on Windows tools but add bash/zsh to be able to use basic Linux tools like sed, awk, grep and similar. Even though WSL could be added to the VM version of dfirws I prefer to have Linux tools running in Remnux, SIFT och Kali.

## Releases

The goal is to start doing releases of dfirws.

## Samples

Samples should be available for as many tools as possible.
