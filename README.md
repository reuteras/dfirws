# dfirws: DFIR in Windows Sandbox

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

DFIRWS is a solution to do DFIR work in a Windows Sandbox. To avoid having to download and install tools manually from many different sources, the tools are downloaded and prepared for use in a Windows Sandbox or in a VM (only VMWare Workstation at the moment). Therefore the tools is suitable in environment without internet access.

DFIRWS has been enhanced since its start and now contains the following main parts.

- **downloadFiles.ps1** - download, update and prepare tools to use for DFIR work. Also downloads enrichment data and updates ClamAV signatures. The script can also be used to verify the downloaded files and cache a local copy of Visual Studio Build Tools.
- **createSandboxConfig.ps1** - create Windows Sandbox configuration files for the tools.
  - **dfirws.wsb** - Windows Sandbox configuration file with network disabled.
  - **network_dfirws.wsb** - Windows Sandbox configuration file with network enabled.
- **createVM.ps1** - create a Windows 11 VM with the tools installed.

DFIRWS should work with the Windows Sandbox in both Windows 10 and Windows 11 even tough it's currently only tested on Windows 11. The VM only creates a Windows 11 VM and currently only works with VMWare Workstation.

**Recommendation:** Exclude the folder where you have the dfirws code from your antivirus program. I don't want to have to recommend this but the reason is that at least Windows Defender will some time classify tools as malware even though they are not. Even though I try to exclude those tools I've found that a file can be classified as malware one day and not the next. The choice is yours.

## Preparation

1. *Programs:* You need to have the programs `7-zip`, `git` and `rclone` installed on your computer to be able to use DFIRWS. If you miss any of the tools you can install them with **winget** by typing the following commands.

```PowerShell
winget install 7zip.7zip
winget install Git.Git
winget install Rclone.Rclone
```

2. *PowerShell:* If you haven't enabled the option to run PowerShell scripts you have to start a Windows Terminal or PowerShell prompt as administrator and run

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

**Important:** This must be done for both **PowerShell** and **pwsh**.

3. *Windows Sandbox:* The Windows Sandbox feature must be enabled on the host. This is true even if you only like to build and run the DFIRWS tools in a VM. The Sandbox feature is used to build and download tools when you run the **downloadFiles.ps1** script.
You can enable the Sandbox feature by using the **Add and remove Windows features** in Windows and add *Windows Sandbox*. An alternative way is to open a Windows terminal as administrator and run:

```PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
```

For more information about Windows Sandbox look at the Microsoft page [Windows Sandbox][wsa].

4. *GitHub token:* You also need a GitHub account to create a GitHub token. If you have a GitHub account you can create a token at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Select *Generate new token (Fine grained or classic)*. Give the token a name and change the default expiration. The token doesn't need any added rights.
Remember to save the token in your password manager since you can't get the value again.

The token is needed to avoid problems with rate limiting on GitHub since most of the tools are downloaded from there and you will be blocked otherwise and the downloads will fail.

5. *MaxMind token (optional):* If you like to use MaxMind data you need a token from [https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).

## Installation and configuration

Start a PowerShell terminal as your regular user and checkout the code from GitHub with the `git` command.

```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws.git
cd dfirws
```

Create the configuration files for the sandbox by running:

```PowerShell
.\createSandboxConfig.ps1
```

Two different configurations for sandboxes will be created:

- dfirws.wsb - network disabled
- network_dfirws.wsb - network enabled

Copy the file *config.ps1.template* to *config.ps1*.

```PowerShell
cp config.ps1.template config.ps1
```

The file *config.ps1* is used by the scripts to specify token for MaxMind and GitHub. If you prefer not to save the GitHub token in *config.ps1* file you can enter it manually when you run **downloadFiles.ps1**. Another safer alternative is to use your password manager and enter the cli command to get the token from the password manager. Examples for 1Password are available in the file *config.ps1.template*.

## Download tools and enrichment data

Before using a sandbox or creating a VM all the tools has to be downloaded and prepared for use in DFIRWS. Sandboxes will be started to run and install packages for Python, bash, Rust, Node.js and more. Since Windows only allows one running Sandbox at the time you have to close any running sandbox before running **downloadFiles.ps1**.

Download programs and prepare them for use by running:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1
```

Enrichment data can be downloaded by running:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -Enrichment
```

ClamAV signatures can be downloaded with freshclam by running:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -Freshclam
```

To simplify the download of tools, enrichment data and ClamAV signatures you can run the following command:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -AllTools -Enrichment -Freshclam
```

To verify you can run the following command:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -Verify
```

Or run everything in one go:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -AllTools -Enrichment -Freshclam -Verify
```

If you like to cache a local copy of Visual Studio Build Tools you can run. **Important: The Visual Studio Build Tools downloader runs on the host and not in a sandbox!**

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -VisualStudioBuildTools
```

Personally I run the following command to download everything and cache Visual Studio Build Tools:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -AllTools -Enrichment -Freshclam -Verify -VisualStudioBuildTools
```

## Usage and configuration of the sandbox

The quickest way to use the DFIRWS is to start a sandbox by clicking on **dfirws.wsb** or running **.\dfirws.wsb** in a PowerShell terminal. The sandbox will start and the tools will be available after a couple of minutes.

The goal for startup time is set to around one minute on a computer with a Intel Core i7 and the default configuration. The following is an example screen of the sandbox running after start.

![Screen when installation is done](./resources/images/screen.png)

You can use the search field in **explorer** to find the tools you like to use. See example below.

![Search for tools](./resources/images/search.png)

By default the sandbox will have clipboard redirection off as well as secure defaults for other settings. If you like to enable clipboard copy and paste you should change `<ClipboardRedirection>Disable</ClipboardRedirection>` to `<ClipboardRedirection>Enable</ClipboardRedirection>`. More information about [Windows Sandbox configuration][wsc].

To customize the sandbox you can copy *local\defaults\config.txt* to *local\config.txt* and change the settings to your liking. The file *local\config.txt* is used by the scripts to specify which tools to install when the sandbox starts. Every tool will still be downloaded and can be installed later in the sandbox if needed.
The difference will be the time it takes to start the sandbox, i.e. running an installer for a program on every start.

Extra tools can be installed in a running **dfirws** sandbox with the script **dfirws-install.ps1**. To list available tools run **Get-Help dfirws-install.ps1**. To install a tool run **dfirws-install.ps1 -<tool>**.

If you like to run your own PowerShell code to customize **dfirws** you can copy *local\defaults\customize-sandbox.ps1* to *local\customize.ps1* and modify it. Observe that the latest version of PowerShell will be installed when you start **dfirws** and that version will be used to run the script. Currently this is PowerShell 7.4.x and some things are different from earlier versions of PowerShell.

More usage information is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/wiki). A local copy of the wiki is available by clicking on the **dfirws wiki** link on the desktop.

## Usage and configuration of the VM

You can create a VM with the dfirws tools installed by running **.\createVM.ps1**. Currently only VMWare Workstation is supported on Windows x64. The script will download the Windows 11 Enterprise ISO from Microsoft and create a VM with the tools installed. The VM will be created  in the root folder of the checked out repository.

- The VM will be created with 4 cores and 16 GB of memory.
- The VM will be created with a 300 GB sparse disk (space is not preallocated).
- The VM will be created with a NAT network adapter.
- The VM will be created with a user named *dfirws* with password *password*.

You can change the settings by copying *local\default\variables.pkr.hcl* to *local\variables.pkr.hcl* and modify the settings to your liking. You can for example change setting for autounattend to change the default keyboard to US (Swedish is the default).

Currently there is now way to update the tolls in the VM. You have to delete the VM and run **.\createVM.ps1** again.

## Update

Update scripts used to create the sandbox (i.e. this code) by running `git pull` and then update the tools by running **.\downloadFiles.ps1** again. Check *.\local\defaults\config.txt* for changed and added configuration options. You can also opt to only update parts of the included tools. To update Python tools run:

```PowerShell
.\downloadFiles.ps1 -Python
```

To see available options run **Get-Help .\downloadFiles.ps1**.
