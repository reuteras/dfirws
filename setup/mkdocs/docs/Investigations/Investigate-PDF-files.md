# Investigate PDF files

There are a couple of tools available in **dfirws** to investigate PDF files. Some of them are:

- **pdf-parser.py**
- **[pdfalyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer)**
- **pdfid.py**
- **PDFStreamDumper**
- **[peepdf-3](https://pypi.org/project/peepdf-3/)** (virtualenv name _peepdf3_)

There is a Jupyter [Notebook](https://github.com/reuteras/dfirws/blob/main/setup/jupyter/pdf.ipynb) available to analyse PDF files.
