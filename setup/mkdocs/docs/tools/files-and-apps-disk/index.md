| [Sleuthkit](sleuthkit.md) | The Sleuth Kit® (TSK) is a library and collection of command line digital forensics tools that allow you to investigate volume and file system data. The library can be incorporated into larger digital forensics tools and the command line tools can be directly used to find evidence. | disk-forensics, filesystem, forensics | `.dd`, `.raw`, `.E01`, `.img`, `.vmdk` |
| [dfir_ntfs](dfir-ntfs.md) |  | ntfs, filesystem, forensics, disk-forensics | `.mft`, `.dd`, `.raw`, `.img` |
| [mft2bodyfile](mft2bodyfile.md) | The mft2bodyfile tool is a command-line utility for parsing Master File Table (MFT) files from NTFS file systems and optionally the corresponding USN Journal to create bodyfile output. The bodyfile format is commonly used in digital forensics for timeline analysis. This tool can help investigators extract valuable information about files and directories from MFT records, such as file names, timestamps, and metadata. | filesystem, forensics, ntfs, bodyfile | `.mft` |
