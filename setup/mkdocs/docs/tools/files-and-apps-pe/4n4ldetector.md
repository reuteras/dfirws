## Tips
4n4lDetector is a powerful static analysis tool focused on Microsoft Windows executables, libraries, drivers, and memory dumps, while its integrated modules can analyze virtually any file type with reliable performance and accurate detection.

    It performs deep inspection of Portable Executable (PE) structures, sections, headers, and resources to identify anomalies, obfuscation layers, and embedded malicious components. Beyond standard PE analysis, its specialized modules extract and classify strings, metadata, and embedded code from non-PE files, extending its scope to a wide range of binary formats.
